# Tauri direct local sources

The desktop Local videos provider uses the operating system file/folder picker.
Selected videos remain in their original location: app data stores only small
JSON records, not copies of media. A folder selection scans media recursively;
non-media files and symlinks are skipped. Refresh scans the connected folders again and discovers new files. Existing
IDs and unavailable file references are retained; exact source paths are
deduplicated.

The picker is `tauri-plugin-dialog` 2.7.3, exposed through the application's
`offline_media_import_files` and `offline_media_import_folder` commands. There is
no HTTP API for submitting an arbitrary filesystem path. These commands return
the private loopback endpoint, and the UI fetches its catalog. They do not upload
the picked files to that endpoint.

The picker command schedules background discovery and returns without waiting
for the entire directory. The private catalog exposes cumulative items with
`scanning`, `scanned`, nullable `total`, and an optional `scanError`. While it is
scanning, the frontend polls every 250 ms and publishes changed snapshots. Adding
a folder starts playback when an eligible item becomes available; later entries
append without reopening the playing video. When restoring a saved selection,
the frontend passes its stable item ID to `offline_media_endpoint`. The native
library reads that one metadata record and validates its original file before
starting the full background scan. The first catalog can therefore contain the
saved video even when its record would be near the end of directory enumeration.
Playback resumes from the profile's saved position; later catalog batches do
not reopen it. Each Tauri instance uses its own metadata and profile selection.

The preferred lookup accepts only an existing opaque item ID, never a path. It
is bounded so a missing or unresponsive source cannot block scan startup. An
unavailable saved item still follows the existing recovery flow; a different
video is not substituted. Reading an endpoint during an active scan does not
restart that scan.

The standard loading dialog shows its loading title once and one count of
playable videos found. Internal scan counters remain available for diagnostics
and stall detection; they are not a second visible count or downloaded bytes.
Unchanged polling does not reset the 60-second stall timeout.
Catalog polling does not start a second scan. Explicit Refresh requests a new
scan, and source changes preserve existing item IDs.

The existing Rust byte-range server opens the original files read-only. URLs use
opaque IDs and a random per-process token rather than filesystem paths. JSON
catalogs expose source names, availability, and item source IDs, not full paths.
The local server listens only on `127.0.0.1`.

`offline_media_remove_source` (and the authenticated DELETE source route) removes
the source's metadata and references. It never removes an original linked file.
Legacy private imports remain playable and can still be deleted as private
copies. Missing/moved originals remain listed unavailable instead of triggering
a copy. Reconnect the original drive/folder or choose a new source. macOS privacy
restrictions may require allowing folder access again; this is a desktop Tauri
implementation, not a sandbox security-scoped bookmark implementation.

The shared server distribution retains its explicit upload library. Server
uploads and native desktop source linking are different operations.

Verification completed: Rust core tests cover persisted links, nested scans,
byte-range reads, unavailable originals, unchanged source files after disconnect,
legacy upload behavior, and symlink exclusion. `cargo check -p ottplay-tauri`
passes. OS-picker UI and actual video decoding need native app verification.
