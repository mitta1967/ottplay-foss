# Plex on each player

Choose **Plex** in the provider list, then **Sign in with Plex**. The official Plex sign-in page opens in a browser. On a TV, open `plex.tv/link` on a phone or computer and enter the displayed code. Choose an available Plex server after signing in; the player checks its connection and opens the library. **Back** cancels sign-in or server connection.

For a manual connection, enter the Plex server address (for example `http://192.168.1.25:32400`) and its access token, then choose **Save and open library**. The token is masked in the settings screen. Prefer an HTTPS Plex endpoint for an HTTPS browser player: access to local HTTP endpoints depends on the browser's local-network permissions and mixed-content policy. Native players can use the transport supported by their build. The Play distribution retains its HTTPS policy.

Plex is a library provider: it opens library sections, search, folders and media. It does not flatten the collection into TV channels. Switching to Plex preserves other providers' saved connections, playlists and favorites.

The [illustrated playback lifecycle](#loading-navigation-and-shutdown) explains
loading, cancellation and file changes. The [review process and results](#reliability-review-process-and-results)
record the regression checks behind these guarantees.

**Browse folders** opens the server's filesystem hierarchy. Items without a title
use alternate Plex metadata or a filename, with **Untitled** as a final fallback.
The heading keeps the selected folder's name instead of Plex's generic `Folder`
label. Approaching the last three rows automatically loads the next page into
the same list. **Loading…** is replaced by the next items without moving the
selection or adding another breadcrumb. A failed request keeps the existing
items and offers a selectable retry row; **Back** still opens the parent folder.
Selecting a video starts an ordered queue of that folder’s files. Natural completion
plays the next file in the same folder, including files on later catalog pages.
The selected filename and an animated loading dialog appear immediately while
the player collects the folder and resolves the file. Other list selections are
blocked during this wait. **Back** cancels and keeps the same file selected;
a connection error returns to the list for retry. Once the stream is handed to
the decoder, its normal buffering indicator follows actual video readiness.
Subfolders are excluded. **Shuffle: Off** starts its videos in a random order. The
queue includes every page of that folder and applies the current title filter;
it does not descend into subfolders. A failed page cancels the new queue.

During full-screen Plex playback, **Left/Right** seek backward/forward by
10 seconds and **Up/Down** play the next/previous file. These controls also apply
to a remote Plex queue while another TV provider is selected. Dedicated volume
buttons still control volume; open lists and dialogs retain their own navigation.

If switching files needs a folder or metadata request, a loading wait appears.
**Up/Down** can adjust the pending selection; **Back** cancels it and keeps the
current file selected. Temporary connection
failures are retried up to three attempts. A failed or incomplete folder never
becomes a partial playback queue. If the server remains unavailable, retry the
arrow after checking the connection.

The playback buttons appear beside the description. **Repeat** cycles through
**All**, **One**, and **Off**: repeat the queue, repeat the current video, or finish
after its last video. Remote shortcuts are **5** (or **Play**) for shuffle and
**9** for repeat. Shuffle visibly changes from **Off** through **Loading** to **On**.
Press **5** again to cancel loading or switch the current queue back to folder
order without restarting the video; **Play** explicitly starts a fresh shuffle.
Both the keyboard number row and numeric keypad work. The repeat preference is
saved per media source. Back, Stop,
changing the filter or choosing another item cancels a pending queue launch.

On reopening the player, Plex continues the last unfinished video at its saved
position, including seconds within the first minute. It resolves the Plex item
again instead of retaining an expiring stream URL. Compatible HLS waits for its
initial media buffer before applying the saved position. **Enter/OK** reopens
the saved folder with the playing file selected; **Back** returns through its saved
breadcrumbs. The folder queue is rebuilt from the current server catalog and
continues from that file, respecting the saved repeat setting. Older checkpoints
restore the saved folder directly even when they do not contain its full
breadcrumb trail. Tauri saves the current
position before its explicit Exit action. If the file is unavailable, the
library opens for another selection. Disabled watch history and finished videos
do not trigger automatic playback; the parental PIN still applies.

The **Playback** setting offers:

- **Automatic** — original files when the current device reports support; compatible HLS when conversion is needed.
- **Original file** — direct playback, using the device's own decoder.
- **Compatible HLS** — Plex prepares a stream for the player. Conversion speed depends on the Plex server and source format.

When the device supports HEVC through Media Source Extensions, compatible HLS uses fragmented MP4, preserves HEVC video at its source resolution and requests AAC audio. For HEVC/Opus files this avoids unnecessary video encoding on the NAS while adapting audio for WebKit.

The selected server address, its access token and playback preference are stored in the current device's provider profile as `plexcfg`. Account sign-in also saves that server's identity and connection candidates. Each time the provider opens, it checks which connection is reachable, so a laptop can move between home Wi-Fi and the internet without signing in again. Browsing history stays associated with the same server and server credential. Editing the address or token manually clears these account connection candidates.

Remote control can update the selected Plex provider through the `provider_settings` request with `{"provider":"plex","settings":{"server":"https://plex.example:32400","token":"YOUR_SERVER_TOKEN"}}`. First setup requires the server and token together. Later requests may update either field; the omitted credential and playback preference are preserved. Provider restrictions and the player's parental settings lock still apply. Tokens must contain no whitespace or control characters and must be at most 1024 characters. Server URLs must use HTTP or HTTPS, with no embedded credentials, query, fragment, or parent-directory path segments.

A successful response contains only the field names, `provider: "plex"`, and `saved: true`; it never includes the token or server address and does not claim that connection succeeded. Saving retires the old library and reloads the provider. Changing either credential clears account connection candidates; other providers' settings remain untouched.

Account sign-in tokens remain in memory during server discovery. No environment variables, central player-server configuration or NAS deployment are required. A settings backup containing this profile also contains its server credential.

## Ordered queues from the command server

An updated player and controller support an explicit list of Plex `ratingKey` IDs:

```sh
ott l plex preview 78777 78776 78775
ott l plex play 78777 78776 78775
ott l plex queue
ott l plex next
ott l plex prev
ott l plex stop
```

To select a complete Plex library without entering individual media IDs:

```sh
ott l plex libraries
ott l plex library --preview "Tom and Jerry"
ott l plex shuffle "Tom and Jerry"
ott l plex library --shuffle id:16
ott l plex shuffle "Кукутики"
```

These commands use the player's saved Plex connection. `id:16` selects library
section 16; it is not a media ratingKey. A plain numeric name remains a library
name. Selection first checks normalized exact titles, then a unique partial
match. Ambiguous names fail without changing playback; use `plex libraries`
and an explicit section ID to disambiguate.

Movie libraries collect movies, and TV libraries collect episodes across their
shows and seasons. The player reads every inventory and media page before
starting playback, accepts at most 1,000 library entries and 500 videos, and
rejects duplicate, incomplete or changing results. Music libraries and physical
filesystem folder traversal are not supported by this command. A failed lookup
or collection leaves existing playback intact. Preview collects and validates
metadata without starting a decoder. Shuffle makes one permutation of the
complete result; subsequent episodes retain that order.

Library queues validate each video's file metadata while reading the complete
catalog. They reuse those records instead of asking Plex for the same metadata
again in one large request. The first video is still resolved separately before
playback starts. A missing or invalid file entry rejects the whole queue rather
than silently skipping a video.

On older players, `One or more Plex items are unavailable or not playable` can
also mean that this redundant metadata request timed out. The message alone
does not prove that the library or its files are missing. Reload an updated
player and check the library without starting playback:

```sh
ott -t 45 l plex library --shuffle --preview "Кукутики"
```

Library commands require the separately advertised `plex_library` v1 capability.
Existing `plex play ID...` and `plex preview ID...` remain available on older
players. Library discovery shares the queue's cancellation, source and runtime
checks: Stop, replacement playback, changed settings or request expiry cannot
be undone by a late library response. List and preview cannot replace a pending
play operation. The operation journal records library play only. These commands
do not enable kiosk, change repeat settings or rewrite the Plex connection.

The player uses its existing saved Plex profile even while a TV provider such as
M3U is selected. It checks the server and all requested metadata, then resolves
the first stream before handing playback over. The selected TV provider and
saved credentials remain unchanged. A failed preparation leaves existing
playback and any previously accepted queue intact. `preview` checks ordered
metadata without starting playback or replacing a queue. If another remote
request is preparing playback, preview waits behind it. It does not test
physical decoder compatibility.

`play` starts the first ID at zero, ignores saved resume positions, and plays the
IDs exactly in the supplied order. `plex play --shuffle ID...` shuffles the
complete input once in the CLI. Without kiosk, completion of the last item stops
playback. Manual next/previous at a boundary returns an
error without stopping the current item. The completed queue remains available
for status and previous. `ott l next` and `ott l prev` use that accepted queue
until `plex stop` clears it. A failed first queue request does not take over TV
channel navigation. Stop only stops video still owned by the queue, so clearing
an old queue cannot stop a TV channel selected afterwards.

Status distinguishes `preparing`, `playing`, `paused`, `ended`, `error`, and
`idle`; its index is zero-based. Requests contain 1–500 positive decimal IDs
without leading zeros. Responses contain IDs, bounded titles and static errors,
never stream URLs or credentials. Commands target the discovered player runtime;
a reload creates a new runtime and clears this in-memory queue. Disconnecting
remote control cancels a pending launch, but an already accepted queue continues
autonomously through natural completion. A CLI timeout does not prove whether
playback started: inspect status before issuing another play request. The player
processes remote requests serially, so a status or preview command queued during
slow preparation waits for that bounded request to finish.

After restarting the player, use `ott l` to check that it is ready before
starting or stepping a queue. Playback requests are refused while the initial
provider load is incomplete; preview, status and stop remain available. An old
archive-resume prompt cannot override a newer playback command.

`playing` confirms the managed video decoder's state, not that its picture is
visible above every window or overlay. When diagnosing a TV, check the physical
screen as well as status. Decoder errors remove the `playing` state until
playback is confirmed again; they never count as natural completion or skip to
the next film.

If preview reports missing configuration, save a Plex profile on that player.
If it reports connection failure, check that the saved endpoint is reachable
from the player, rather than only from the CLI machine. HTTPS browser players
can still be blocked by mixed-content, CORS or local-network policies; the queue
does not bypass those restrictions or invent a proxy. Native platforms use their
existing Plex transport. Kiosk restrictions still apply when playback is
committed. Ordinary films work with the default parental settings; items
explicitly marked adult require local parental access before starting the queue.
A refused handoff restores the prior media runtime, including its natural-end
continuation, rather than publishing a replacement queue that never started.
Successful playback closes the channel/media list and cancels its stale TV
preview, without restoring PiP. It does not discard an open unsaved settings or
input dialog; close or finish that local draft to uncover the full video.

To retain and loop the queue across application restarts, select the Plex provider,
start the required queue, then enable kiosk:

```sh
ott f10 provider plex
ott f10 plex play --shuffle 78777 78776 78775
ott f10 kiosk on --strict
ott f10 kiosk status
```

Kiosk repeats the same complete shuffled order and stores provider requests,
source identity, cursor and position without retaining expiring stream URLs.
After a page reload, use `kiosk status` for the durable queue; the separate remote
queue controller is in-memory. Use `kiosk off` before replacing the queue or
updating the application. Strict mode blocks local navigation and playback
controls while allowing the information footer for five seconds. On the active
core player, tapping or dragging its timeline seeks within the current episode;
other controls remain locked. This support
is shared by browser/hosted, server, Tauri, and Capacitor Android/iOS builds.

If Plex cannot connect while kiosk is locked, the player keeps the saved kiosk
policy and does not open Plex settings or a modal connection-error dialog.
Inspect `ott f10 kiosk status` for recovery progress. To repair the connection
or edit settings, explicitly unlock the player first:

```sh
ott f10 kiosk off
ott f10 restart
ott f10
ott f10 plex preview 78777 78776 78775
ott f10 plex play 78777 78776 78775
ott f10 plex status
```

Wait for the restarted player to reconnect and finish loading its provider
before starting playback. If necessary, repair its saved Plex connection while
unlocked. `preview` checks server access; confirm actual playback before enabling
`ott f10 kiosk on --strict` again. On older builds that already opened Plex
settings under a strict lock, `ott f10 kiosk off` restores local navigation;
restarting alone retains that lock.

The wire contract is `plex_queue` with `op`, exact `runtime`, and `ids` for
`play`/`preview`. `capabilities.plex_queue` advertises version 1, supported
operations and `max_items: 500`. The CLI respects older players that still
advertise a smaller maximum. The shared examples and bounds are in
[`contracts/plex-queue-v1.json`](../contracts/plex-queue-v1.json).

For access away from home, the selected Plex server must have a reachable remote connection. Plex may impose account or subscription requirements for remote personal-media playback; see [Plex remote playback requirements](https://support.plex.tv/articles/requirements-for-remote-playback-of-personal-media/).

## Loading, navigation and shutdown

![Plex playback lifecycle: an owned loading screen, explicit file selection across natural completion, and early session cleanup](images/plex-playback-lifecycle.svg)

A loading screen belongs to the request that opened it. During startup, the
player collects the saved folder and resolves a fresh stream before playing.
Replacing that screen cancels both stages; a late result cannot start a video
behind a newer dialog. Cancellation preserves the saved playback position.

During a full-screen file change, repeated **Up/Down** presses update the pending
destination. If the old video ends meanwhile, the player carries that exact
destination into the new playback generation. Responses from the previous
request are ignored. Navigation performed during cancellation also wins over
the old request. **Left/Right** remain seek controls for the current video.

Catalog browsing continues after a full 200-row page even when Plex omits
`totalSize`. A short or empty page finishes that traversal, with cursor and
catalog bounds still enforced. Preparing a playback queue continues to require
the complete validated collection.

Account connection probes accept both JSON and XML from Plex Media Server.
They verify the server identity before sending its token. The cloud account
API keeps its JSON contract. The provider and account modules exchange the
parser through their published API so the same behavior survives bundle
isolation and minification.

On page exit, the Plex client releases its session during the capture phase of
`pagehide`, before queue and player cleanup. This lets the final stop use a
keepalive request. Repeated cleanup does not send a second stop; disposing the
client removes the same capture listener.

## Reliability review process and results

The October 2026 review used separate provider, player and release audits.
Each accepted fix started with a reproduced failure, then received a regression
test and independent review. Browser runs exercised the shipped bundle as well
as the source-level checks. This caught an isolated-module parser error and the
WebKit shutdown ordering issue before release.

![Local Plex verification results: Chromium and WebKit acceptance, trusted touch input, domain regression groups and build checks](images/plex-validation-results.svg)

This is a local verification snapshot for code commit
[`bc81e98e`](https://github.com/open-ott-play/ottplay-foss/commit/bc81e98ebdabd113fdbe6ec7c18ad85316fc4a6e),
reviewed in [PR #780](https://github.com/open-ott-play/ottplay-foss/pull/780):

- Chromium passed 13 Plex browser scenarios. The native-HLS case applies to
  WebKit and is excluded from the Chromium count.
- WebKit passed all 14 Plex browser scenarios, including native HLS and remote
  queue replay after reload.
- The loading-screen touch scenario passed separately in Chromium, Firefox
  and WebKit using trusted browser input.
- Plex client checks passed 41 scenarios; authentication passed 20 scenarios
  using real jQuery 1.11.1 and 4.0 transports and isolated provider modules.
  Remote queues passed 39 behavior groups; the media library passed 134 groups.
- Unified tests, TypeScript, lint, production build, emitted-bundle checks,
  ES5 grammar and size checks passed. The complete web player measured
  964,842 bytes against the unchanged 964,900-byte limit.

Scenario and group counts describe the named suites; they are not a percentage
of code coverage or a count of unique assertions. Browser evidence does not
replace physical TV/decoder acceptance. These results record local validation;
publication also requires the repository's CI and release gates.

The delivery sequence is: reproduce and review the fix, validate the built
player, merge the approved PR, then publish the verified platform packages.
Beta uses the compact validation path. RC adds the full qualification and
fuzzing requirements described in the [release workflow](release-workflow.md).
The release manifest binds the published files to their source and checksums.

To repeat the focused checks:

```sh
node tests/test_plex_client.cjs
node tests/test_plex_auth.cjs
node tests/test_media_library.cjs
node tests/test_plex_provider.cjs
node tests/test_remote_plex.cjs

npx playwright test tests/browser/plex-provider.spec.cjs --browser=all --grep 'Plex file selection' --workers=2
```

The provider tests also cover local profile isolation, masked token editing,
authenticated readiness, stale connection callbacks, server choice and
cancellation after switching providers. Install the Playwright browsers required
by the selected commands before running browser acceptance.
