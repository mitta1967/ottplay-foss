# Subtitle appearance

Open **Settings → Interface settings → Subtitle appearance**. Choose the font,
font size, text color, black outline thickness and black background opacity,
then use the standard **Save Settings** action. Back cancels the draft. **Reset
to default** resets all five draft choices; save to apply the reset.

Each choice starts at **Player default**. Default settings leave the renderer's
appearance untouched. Custom rules change only the cue's font, color, shadow and
background: they do not change its position, line, alignment or timing. Font size
is proportional to the rendered video image, including a reduced preview or PiP,
rather than the application window. Size percentages use a base of four percent
of image height. Outline choices are one, two or three CSS pixels; background
choices range from transparent to opaque in quarter steps.

Settings apply to native HTML video captions and Video.js rendered captions where
the browser supports the relevant cue CSS properties. Platform-controlled PiP,
external native video surfaces and captions embedded in the picture may not accept
web CSS. These controls cannot create missing subtitle languages or change text
already embedded in video pixels.

The five application settings are part of ordinary profile export/import. Invalid
indices fall back to their defaults. Switching channels does not reset them.
The editor and style implementation are a separate, versioned
`dist/subtitle-appearance.js` asset: default startup does not request it. The asset
loads when the settings page is opened, or when saved custom appearance must be
applied. Navigating Back or changing source while that request is pending cannot
reopen the cancelled page.

The build measures the optional asset separately and includes it in complete
payload totals for web, server and native distributions. The eager player and
existing provider budgets are unchanged. Existing interface settings move into
this same optional asset to keep the startup budget intact.
