# Local videos and offline playback

The canonical hosted player is [player.ottplay.here.now](https://player.ottplay.here.now/).
Deploy this player to the existing `liminal-sketch-vv8r` site in the `ottplay`
workspace; do not substitute a preview URL for the normal player address.
Preserve its `.herenow` proxy/data configuration, `local/hosted.js`, remote-input
configuration, demo/MSX assets and content-addressed hosted runtimes when staging
a web update. Refresh `build-info.json` and the offline shell after assembling
the production directory.

**Local videos** plays files from connected local sources without making an
additional OTT copy. Open **Settings → Local videos**, or select **Local videos**
from the provider list. Its controls use the player's normal settings list:
**Add folder**, **Add files**, **Grant access** when needed, **Refresh**,
**Play local videos**, and **Disconnect** for each source. There is no separate
file-manager dialog. The operating system's file/folder picker still appears to
let you choose what OTT may read.

Choose a folder or files, then choose **Play local videos** to open the channel
list. OTT saves references and small metadata records, not a second copy of the
movies. The original disk, SD card, or directory must remain accessible. Moving
or deleting originals, removing an SD card, or revoking access can make entries
unavailable. Reconnect the source or grant access again; an unavailable source
is not silently copied or substituted. **Disconnect** removes the library
reference and leaves the original media untouched.

Libraries made by the earlier copy-based version remain readable. Their entries
are marked as imported copies and expose **Remove copy**. This deletes OTT's
stored copy, not the original file selected during the old import. OTT cannot
infer the old source location or automatically convert such copies into links.
To reclaim duplicate storage, connect the original first, verify playback, and
then remove the old imported copy.

## Platform behavior

- **Capacitor Android:** Android's Storage Access Framework grants read access to
  selected documents/folders. OTT persists the document URIs and reads the
  original through a private loopback streaming server. This includes the
  API 22 Fire variant, subject to the device providing a working document picker.
  Sources must support seeking; unseekable provider streams are rejected without
  falling back to a copy. **Refresh** rescans connected folders for additions.
  See [Android sources](android-local-media-sources.md).
- **Capacitor iOS:** the Files picker selects files/folders in place. OTT stores
  document bookmarks, keeps scoped read access active for playback, and rescans
  connected directories on refresh. See [iOS sources](offline-media-ios-direct.md).
- **Tauri desktop:** a native picker selects files/folders. OTT retains paths and
  metadata, and a private loopback server reads the originals with byte-range
  support. **Refresh** rescans connected folders for additions. It does not
  upload selected files into
  application storage. OS privacy permissions and drive availability still apply.
- **Browser / here.now / server-hosted player:** supported browsers retain
  File System Access handles in IndexedDB and create playback URLs from the
  original files. Refresh rescans linked directories. If the browser expires
  access, **Continue playback** renews permission and resumes the local provider.
  Chrome/Edge desktop support this mode;
  unsupported browsers display an explicit error and do not use a hidden
  copy-based fallback. Use the native Android app on older Fire tablets.
- **Optional remote server library:** media lives on the server. Its existing
  authenticated upload API is still an explicit copy to server disk. Selecting
  that library is not direct access to a folder on the client. The local-source
  controls do not silently upload browser-selected files to it.

A cloud provider can download/cache a selected file itself. Connecting a cloud
placeholder does not make it offline. Select files physically available on the
device for playback without any network. The feature does not download IPTV
channels, mirror Plex libraries, transcode media, or import multi-file HLS
packages. H.264/AAC in MP4 is a useful starting format for old Fire devices, but
codec support still depends on the installed player/WebView.

Chrome may ask **“Allow this site to view and copy files?”** after a folder is selected. This is its standard read-access prompt. OTT requests `mode: "read"`, stores handles and metadata, and plays the originals; it does not create a second video copy. The browser wording describes the permission granted, not an import or upload in progress. See the [Chromium permission strings](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/5b8b36772fbb0a49fa285efe5fb585f4093c2cb3%5E%21/).

## Offline application startup

Bundled native applications can start without a website connection. A hosted
browser also needs its application shell installed for offline startup: use
HTTPS or localhost, load the site online once, and wait until **Offline restart**
is ready. Keep the same site address and verify a reload with the network off.
An HTTP LAN page can play already accessible files while open, but cannot
promise an offline cold start. Browser autoplay rules may require pressing Play
or Space after reload.

Local playback automatically reloads the connected sources and restores the
selected file when the browser still grants read access. A saved folder handle
is not itself a permanent permission. In Chrome 122 and later, after reopening
the page, choose **Continue playback**, then **Allow on every visit** in the
browser's permission prompt to retain access for later visits. **Allow this
time** expires when the session ends. An installed web app also retains a grant
after it is allowed. See [Chrome's persistent file permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/persistent-permissions-for-the-file-system-access-api).

If permission has expired, OTT keeps the source and previous selection while
showing the recovery action. It cannot silently approve a browser permission
prompt. Renew access instead of disconnecting and adding the same folder again.
An unplugged drive, moved folder, or revoked permission still requires recovery;
the originals must remain available. File access permission and browser audio
autoplay permission are independent.

The service worker caches a finite list of public player assets and revalidates
them online. It does not cache live streams, playlists, credentials, command
traffic, or arbitrary requests. Source handles and old imported copies are
separate from the application shell and profile backups. Loading Home does not
transfer a library to another device. Different browser profiles and site
origins have separate grants and libraries. Clearing site/application data loses
references and old private copies; it does not delete linked originals.

## Optional server library

Configure both variables before starting `ottplay-server`:

```sh
export OTT_OFFLINE_MEDIA_DIR=/srv/ottplay/local-media
# Supply a private random value of at least 32 URL-safe characters via your secret store.
export OTT_OFFLINE_MEDIA_TOKEN=YOUR_PRIVATE_RANDOM_TOKEN
```

In **Local videos → Server library…**, enter
`https://your-server/offline-media/YOUR_PRIVATE_RANDOM_TOKEN` using the player's
normal text editor. Clear the setting to return to browser-local sources.
A remote library needs a network connection even if its files were originally
uploaded from this client. A Tauri application configures its own loopback
endpoint automatically and does not use these remote-server variables.

Treat the entire remote URL as a credential: anyone holding it can list, import,
play and delete that server library's files. Use HTTPS for remote access and keep
the URL out of public screenshots. The API supports `GET` catalog,
`POST /import?name=Film.mp4` with raw bytes, `GET /FILE_ID` with `Range`, and
`DELETE /FILE_ID`. Uploads stream to disk, accept MP4, M4V, WebM, OGV, MP3, M4A and
OGG, and are limited to 16 GiB per file. A 60-second stalled upload is cancelled.
These limits do not guarantee free disk space. The remote API cannot register
arbitrary client/server paths as native picker grants.

## Kiosk and updates

Select Local videos, choose a playable title, then apply the existing kiosk
command through the authorized command server. Stable entry IDs identify the
saved selection; temporary playback URLs are regenerated. Connect the source
separately on each target device. Kiosk/settings locks prevent local library
changes. Existing screen-off handling continues to govern playback while asleep.

Android, iOS and Tauri native changes require an updated APK, IPA or desktop
application; a hosted JavaScript update cannot add OS picker/bookmark support.
Browser changes arrive through the site and service worker. The files remaining
on a source do not guarantee OTT has permission to access them after an update;
check the actual device and grant access if requested.

## Verification scope

Automated source/range tests and native builds check implementation behavior;
they do not establish codec support or OS permission persistence on every device.
Before claiming a tablet works offline: connect a local MP4/folder; check that
only metadata was added to OTT storage; play and seek; disable the network;
force-stop/restart and reboot; verify the same title; test screen-off/resume;
disconnect the source and confirm the original remains. Also test an absent SD
card or revoked grant and an old imported copy. Real hardware and signed release
validation remain separate from simulator/JVM/browser tests.
